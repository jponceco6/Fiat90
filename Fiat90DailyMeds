    {"DayNum":"Sunday October 18th, 2020", "MeditationTitle":"True Riches", "MeditationDesc":"This passage is the response from God to one who decides to make worldly wealth his goal. In this parable, the rich man had such a bountiful harvest that he decided to tear down his old barns and build bigger ones so as to store the harvest.  Little did this man realize that his life would soon come to an end and that all he stored up would never be used by him. The contrast in this parable is between an abundance of earthly wealth and wealth in what matters to God.  Sure, it may be possible to be rich in both, but accomplishing this would be quite difficult.", "Prayer":"Lord, I desire to be truly rich in grace and mercy rather than in material things.  Help me to always keep the proper priorities in life and to be purified in all of my desires. Jesus, I trust in You.","DailyImg":"0000"},

    {"DayNum":"Monday October 19th, 2020","MeditationTitle":"Overcoming the Trickery of Evil","MeditationDesc": "The Pharisees were hypocrites filled with malice. They were also cowards in that they would not even act on their own malicious plot.  Instead, they sent some of their own disciples to try to trap Jesus.  From the point of view of worldly wisdom, they set a very good trap.  Most likely, the Pharisees sat and discussed this plot in great detail, instructing these messengers on exactly what to say","Prayer":"Lord, I entrust my life to Your perfect wisdom and care. Protect me from all trickery and guard me from the plots of the evil one. Jesus, I trust in You.","DailyImg":"0000"},

    {"DayNum":"Tuesday October 20th, 2020", "MeditationTitle":"Peace on Earth?", "MeditationDesc":"Yes, this is a shocking Scripture at first.  Why would Jesus say that He came to establish not peace but division? This does not at all sound like something He would say. And then to go on saying that family members will be divided against each other is even more confusing. So what is this about? This passage reveals one of the unintended but permitted effects of the Gospel. Sometimes the Gospel brings about a certain disunity. Throughout history, for example, Christians have been severely persecuted for their faith. The example of many martyrs reveals that those who live the faith and preach it may become the target of another.", "Prayer":"Lord, give me grace to keep my eyes on You and Your will and to choose You above everything else in life.  When my faith is challenged give me courage and strength to stay strong in Your love. Jesus, I trust in You.", "DailyImg":"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/545d9eeee4b08c4a3adca405/1418267440538-D83R0D8THTX4LEH5SFQV/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kKAwwdAfKsTlKsCcElEApLR7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UegTYNQkRo-Jk4EWsyBNhwKrKLo5CceA1-Tdpfgyxoog5ck0MD3_q0rY3jFJjjoLbQ/image-asset.jpeg?format=500w"},  
    
    {"DayNum":"Wednesday October 21st, 2020", "MeditationTitle":"Interpreting Our Present Time", "MeditationDesc":"Do you know how to interpret the present time? It is important for us, as followers of Christ, to be able to look honestly at our cultures, societies and world as a whole and interpret it honestly and accurately.  We need to be able to discern the goodness and the presence of God in our world and we need to also be able to identify and interpret the workings of the evil one in our present time.  How well do you do that? One of the tactics of the evil one is the use of manipulation and lies.  The evil one seeks to confuse us in countless ways.  These lies may come through the media, through our political leaders and, at times, even through some religious leaders.  The evil one loves it when there is division and disorder of every kind.", "Prayer":"Lord, help me to interpret the present time and to see the errors fostered all around us, as well as Your goodness manifest in so many ways.  Give me courage and wisdom so that I may reject what is evil and seek that which is from You.  Jesus, I trust in You.","DailyImg":"0000"},
